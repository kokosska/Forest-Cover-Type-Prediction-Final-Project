# Forest Cover Type Prediction Final Project
 
This is a project launched at Codecademy and it is a part of Data Scientist Career Path. 

This is a final portfolio project from Codecademy. In this project there was no database provided by Codecademy platform. The goal is to use different sources to find a database and work on it. I decided to chose Kaggle and I found a datebase - Forest Cover Type Prediction.

The goals of this project are: take data from Kaggle, explore the dataset, preprocess attributes, make and compare various multi-class models
